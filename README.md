## A comprehensive memory scanning library

scanflow boasts a feature set similar to the likes of CheatEngine, with a simple command line interface. Utilizing [memflow](https://crates.io/memlfow), scanflow works in a wide range of situations - from virtual machines, to dedicated DMA hardware. A simple command line interface is provided, but it can also be used as a standalone library. With performance being at the forefront, scanflow should be able to achieve revolutionary memory scan speeds.
